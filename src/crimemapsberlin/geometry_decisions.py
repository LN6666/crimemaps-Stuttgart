"""Validate LLM geometry selections against reviewed scenes and checked OSM.

The LLM decides whether a reviewed location corresponds to source coordinates
or one or more OSM objects.  This module only checks identity, current hashes,
geometry types and municipal containment, then derives geometry from the
selected source objects.  It never matches names or changes scene semantics.
